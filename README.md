# steven-learns-monads

The purpose of this repos is to exercise / solidify / and experiment with my
knowledge of monads and monad transformers.

In this library, I will be reimplementing some well-known monads, such as the
`State`, `Reader`, and `Writer` monads, and I will be using the `QuickCheck` and
`checkers` libraries to test our implementation of these monads.
